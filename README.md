# Robot Arm Planning

#### Goal
- Construct an arduino-controlled robot arm from materials in the sigma lab.

#### Resources/Materials
- 4-6 servos
- Arduino
- 9V battery pack
- Gears made out of 3mm acrylic
- 5 mm LEDs
- Switch (for power)
- Potentiometers (for controlling servos) 
- Photo interrupters
- 3D printer and laser cutter
#### Outline
#### Scope
#### Schedule
1/31 - finished plan & sitting together.

2/7 - rough dimensions figured out on solidworks, 4 servos with potentiometers coded on circuitpython.

2/14 - servos and dials wired, processing gui started
